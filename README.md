# **Health & Fitness App**  

## **Project Overview**  
This **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project** is a **Health & Fitness Application** designed to help users manage their **meal plans, nutrition tracking, and recipes**. The application provides a structured way to create personalized **nutrition plans**, track **daily meals**, and manage **healthy recipes** efficiently.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Meal Planning:** Users can create and customize their meal plans based on their dietary goals.  
âœ… **Nutrition Tracking:** Calculates daily calorie intake and nutritional values from meals.  
âœ… **Recipe Management:** Stores and retrieves healthy recipes with ingredients and nutritional details.  
âœ… **Database Integration:** Saves user data, meal plans, and recipes for future use.  
âœ… **OOP Principles:** Implements **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction** for modular design.  

## **Project Structure**  
ðŸ“‚ **MealPlan.hpp** â€“ Header file defining meal planning functionalities.  
ðŸ“‚ **NutritionPlan.cpp & NutritionPlan.hpp** â€“ Classes for nutrition tracking and calculations.  
ðŸ“‚ **Recipe.cpp** â€“ Manages recipe storage and retrieval.  
ðŸ“‚ **OOP PROJECT DATABASE.xlsx** â€“ Database storing user meal plans and recipes.  
ðŸ“‚ **Project UML.jpg** â€“ UML diagram illustrating the class relationships.  
ðŸ“‚ **finalproject.zip / oopproject.zip** â€“ Complete project files.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **C++** (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- **Excel Database** (for data storage)  
- **UML Diagrams** (for system design)  

## **Setup & Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HealthFitnessApp.git
   ```  
2. Compile the C++ files using g++:  
   ```bash
   g++ -o fitnessApp NutritionPlan.cpp Recipe.cpp main.cpp
   ```  
3. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   ./fitnessApp
   ```  

## **Future Improvements**  
ðŸ”¹ Integration with a **GUI** for better user experience.  
ðŸ”¹ Adding a **workout tracker** alongside meal planning.  
ðŸ”¹ Connecting to a **cloud database** for real-time data storage.
